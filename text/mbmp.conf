# MBMP configuration file
#	Use to map key press to commands
#	
# Format is the command <whitespace> then the key to map <whitespace> then 
# a text description surronded by double quotes.  More than one key may be
# mapped to a command, in that case separate the keys by a comma.
#
#	Commands in the first column must be typed exactly as shown here.
# Keys and Description fields may be modified by the user. 
#
# Keys are not case sensitive.  The following strings are recogonized:  
# "Ctrl", "Shift", "Alt" and "Meta. Each must be followed by a plus sign
# and then the key (example: Ctrl+S). q
#
#	The following non-character keys are parsed. Entries in the Text
# column are what should be used to describe the key. 
#		Key							Text 
#		Escape key 			esc
#		Space key				space
#		Insert key			ins
#		Delete key			del
#		Up arrow key		up
#		Down arrow key	down
#		Function key		f1 to f12
#
#
#
# A hash (#) indicates a comment. All text on a line after the # is
# treated as a comment and is not parsed. The # may not be used as part
# of a command, there is no combinaion of quotes or escapes that will 
# allow # to be used.  In the case of multiple shortcuts keys only
# the first one will be displayed in the menus, although each shortcut
# will be active.
